XGBoost classification model for Kaggle competition.

Includes Data Cleaning and Feature Engineering.
Statistical tests are used to determine the most relevant features.
The model uses a two-stage grid search (the first one for main hyperparameters and the second one for regularization hyperparameters), with K Fold validation to better understand the performance of the model.
